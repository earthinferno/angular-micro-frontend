# ErtMfeRepo2
This project contains an Angular App that is intended to be invoked by a seperate composing shell (bootstrap) app. 

It conforms to the Micro-front end pattern. This enables different teams to work on vertical slices (decoupled modules) of the application seperately from each other in decoupled code repositories.

The app is intended to be invoked by this app: gitcloud.ert.com/graham.small/micro-frontend-shell. It will need to served as below for the Shell app to call it.

It can be run (served) independently.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.6.
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
